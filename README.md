# Password-Generator-php
This project is a Password Generator developed using HTML, CSS, and PHP that allows users to generate a secure and random password based on their preferred length. The user enters the desired password length through an input field, and upon submission, the application generates a password that exactly matches the specified length.

The backend logic uses PHP to create the password by randomly selecting characters from a predefined set of letters, numbers, and special characters. The generated password is then displayed on the same page, providing instant feedback to the user. Basic validation is applied to ensure that the entered length is valid before generating the password.

This project helps beginners understand string manipulation, random number generation, and form handling in PHP, while also practicing frontend design using CSS to create a clean and user-friendly interface.
